# Spring Boot Backend Internship Project

## Overview

This repository contains a part of the backend component of my internship project, designed to support a larger application( built using Angular and Spring boot) . Using Spring Boot and Spring Security, the backend manages data storage, retrieval, and processing while providing secure RESTful APIs for frontend integration.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations**: The backend supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for efficient data management.

- **Authentication and Authorization**: Implements Spring Security for secure user authentication and role-based authorization.

- **Database Integration**: It integrates with a PostgreSQL database for effective data storage and retrieval.

- **RESTful API**: Provides RESTful APIs for seamless communication with frontend components.

- **Custom Security Configuration**: Utilizes a custom security configuration to control access to specific API endpoints.
